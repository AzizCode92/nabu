        Compute the loss

        Creates the operation to compute the cross-enthropy loss for every input
        frame (if you want to have a different loss function, overwrite this
        method)

        Args:
            targets: a [batch_size, max_target_length] tensor containing the
                targets
            logits: a [batch_size, max_logit_length, dim] tensor containing the
                logits
            logit_seq_length: the length of all the logit sequences as a
                [batch_size] vector
            target_seq_length: the length of all the target sequences as a
                [batch_size] vector
